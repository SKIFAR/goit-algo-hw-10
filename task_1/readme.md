# Comparison of Greedy and Dynamic Programming Algorithms

## Overview
This assignment compares two fundamental algorithmic approaches — **Greedy algorithms** and **Dynamic Programming (DP)** — based on their time efficiency, scalability, and suitability for solving optimization problems.

Both methods aim to find an optimal or near-optimal solution but differ significantly in their strategies and computational costs.

## Conceptual Difference

| Aspect | Greedy Algorithm | Dynamic Programming |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Approach** | Builds a solution step by step by choosing the best immediate (local) option at each step. | Breaks the problem into overlapping subproblems, solves each once, and reuses those solutions. |
| **Optimality** | May not always produce the globally optimal solution. | Always guarantees the optimal solution (if the problem satisfies optimal substructure). |
| **Computation** | Simple and fast — does not revisit previous decisions. | More complex — stores and reuses results of previous computations. |
| **Memory Use** | Usually minimal. | Higher — requires additional space for storing subproblem results. |

## Time Complexity and Scalability

| Algorithm Type | Typical Time Complexity | Efficiency for Large Inputs |
|----------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Greedy** | Usually **O(n)** or **O(n log n)** depending on sorting or selection steps. | Highly efficient — scales well even with large data. |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Often **O(n × m)** or higher, depending on the number of states and transitions. | Slower for large inputs due to exponential or quadratic growth in computation and memory. |

## Performance Analysis
- **Greedy algorithms** are faster and simpler to implement. They are ideal when:
  - The problem exhibits a *greedy-choice property*.
  - Approximate or fast solutions are acceptable.
  - Large-scale performance is important.

- **Dynamic programming algorithms** are slower but always find the *best possible solution*. They are suitable when:
  - The problem has *overlapping subproblems* and *optimal substructure*.
  - Accuracy is more important than execution speed.

## Conclusion

- **Greedy algorithms** provide **high efficiency and simplicity**, making them preferable for large-scale or real-time problems where quick decisions are required.
- **Dynamic programming** ensures **guaranteed optimality** but comes at the cost of **higher computational and memory complexity**.
- Therefore, the choice between the two depends on the problem type:
  - Use **Greedy** when local choices lead to global optimality or near-optimal results are acceptable.
  - Use **Dynamic Programming** when precision and guaranteed optimal results are critical, even if execution is slower.

**In summary:**  
Greedy algorithms are faster and scalable; dynamic programming is more powerful but computationally expensive.
